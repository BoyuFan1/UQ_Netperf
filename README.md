# UQ_Netperf

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)** in network throughput predictions. Scientific user facilities generate massive datasets, and remote data transfers play a key role in fields like climate modeling, bioinformatics, and particle physics. Effective UQ can help allocate network and storage resources more efficiently, improving performance and reliability.

The project aims to develop and evaluate UQ methods, including **Bootstrap**, **Conformal Prediction**, and **Predictability, Computability, and Stability (PCS)**, to provide accurate perturbation intervals for predicting future data transfers.

## Methods & Data
- **UQ Techniques**: Bootstrap, Conformal Prediction, PCS Framework.
- **Machine Learning**: Linear, Bagging, Boosting, and Neural Nets.
- **Evaluation**: Coverage probability, interval width, prediction accuracy.
  
### Data
The dataset will be sourced from **Tstat logs** at NERSC (National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center), providing detailed information on network transfers
